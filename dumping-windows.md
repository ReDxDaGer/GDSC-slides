By: Yash Mehrotra, Ayush Dutta

## Why Linux based distributions? 
+ Lighter resource consumption
+ Blazing fast on average hardware
+ Infinitely customisable
+ Made for developers

---

## Linux philosophy
+ Keep it Simple, Stupid
+ DIY and fix-it-yourself
+ Total control over system
+ Open sourced and community maintained

---

## Windows family 

...7,8,8.1,10,11...12?

+ Serial hierarchy

---

## Linux family

➜ debian ⚡ > Ubuntu > Pop OS

+ Parent distros 
+ Derived distros 
+ Tree based hierarchy

> distributions = distros



---
---

## Installing a Linux distro (simplified)

+ Formatting a flash drive bootable
+ Running the installer 
+ Selecting preferences, drives, partitions
+ Rebooting

---

## Installing things on Linux

+ Package managers
+ Binary repositories
+ Flatpaks and Snaps

### Most secure (yet resource intensive)
Flatpaks: Containerised application

---

## The power of sudo

Level of privilege:
+ Root (Administrative)
+ User 

Root privileges can be given to user through the `sudo` utility

---

## What doesn't work on Linux?

+ Some games
+ MS Office

### Suitable replacements

+ Game emulators (like Lutris)
+ Google suite

---

### Future scope

#### Ricing 
Making visually aesthetic modifications to the UI 

#### Heavy Computation
Tasks that require the most resources 
+ Compiling the linux kernel itself!

---

### Future scope 

#### Server management
Most worldwide servers in datacentres use Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/NixOS)


#### Secure
Most malware are often made to target Windows-based distributions.
