# Introduction to Git & Github

> Open talk on discussing git, github and developer workflows

By: Yash Mehrotra, Ayush Dutta

## Prerequisite: Version Control Systems
+ Applications for tracking and managing sets of changes to code
+ Helps with rollbacks and better collaboration among developers
+ Example: Git, Mercurial, SVN, etc.
+ Version control systems allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, tracking changes and enabling easy collaboration.

---

## Prerequisite: Source-Code Registries
+ Services for storing code in remotely hosted repositories.
+ Example: Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.
+ Source-code registries provide a centralized location to store and manage code repositories, facilitating collaboration and code sharing among teams and communities.

### Git: a revolutionary system
World's most beloved version control system for developers, known for its distributed nature and efficient branching and merging capabilities.

---
## Why Use GitHub?

+ Version Control: Git provides robust version control features for tracking changes and collaborating on code.
+ Collaboration: GitHub facilitates seamless collaboration among developers through features like Pull Requests, Issues, and Code Reviews.
+ Open Source: GitHub is a popular platform for hosting and contributing to open-source projects, fostering a vibrant community of developers.
+ Portfolio: GitHub acts as a portfolio for developers to showcase their work and contributions to various projects.

---

## Basic GitHub Concepts

+ Repository: A project folder containing all the files and revision history for a project.
+ Branch: An independent line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
+ Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the codebase, with a descriptive message explaining the changes.
+ Pull Request: A request to merge changes from one branch into another branch, typically used to merge feature branches into the main codebase.
+ Fork: A copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Collaborative workflow

1. Create a Repository: Set up a new repository on GitHub to host your project.
2. Create a Branch: Create a new branch for the feature or fix you want to work on.
3. Make Changes: Edit, add, or remove files in your local copy of the project.
4. Commit Changes: Stage and commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
5. Push to Remote: Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
6. Create a Pull Request: Open a Pull Request to propose merging your changes into the main branch.
7. Review and Merge: Collaborators can review, discuss, and approve the Pull Request before merging it.

---

## GitHub Features

+ Issues: Track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to a project.
+ Pull Requests: Propose, review, and merge code changes into a repository.
+ Projects: Kanban-style boards for organizing and prioritizing work.
+ Wiki: Collaborative documentation and knowledge base for your project.
+ Insights: Analytics and metrics for monitoring project activity and contributions.

---

## Github Features

GitHub offers features and tools to facilitate collaboration among teams:
+ Organizations: Manage teams, repositories, and access permissions within an organization.
+ Teams: Group members with specific access levels and responsibilities.
+ Codespaces: Cloud-based development environments for coding and collaboration.
+ Copilot: AI-powered coding assistant that provides suggestions and explanations as you code.
+ GitHub Actions: Automate workflows and build, test, and deploy your applications directly from GitHub.
